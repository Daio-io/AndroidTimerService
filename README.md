AndroidTimerService
===================

A simple Countdown TimerService which can fire off an event once the countdown has finished.

Build in Android Studio.

The easiest way to use the service is to extend the TimerService and @Override the countdownFinisihed() method
with the work you want to be completed when the countdown finishes.

See the TestServiceExtension class for an example implementing this.

The TestActivity has a quick example of starting the service.
